However, changing norms and the adoption of social media allowed younger generations to express themselves more openly and easily.

In fact, there are significant differences between generations in this area.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>73% of baby boomers began managing their own finances between age 18 and 24. Only 16% started overseeing their own accounts before 18.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>59% of Gen X began managing their own bills between 18 and 24. A far higher number compared to baby boomers, 28%, started before age 18.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>56% of millennials took over their accounts between 18 and 24; 23% took responsibility for their money before age 18.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Surprisingly, 15% of millennials didn\u2019t start tracking their bills and budgets until they were between 25 and 30 years old.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>72% of Gen Z started managing their finances between the ages of 18 and 24, with only 17% starting before age 18.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Most Americans started their money management responsibilities at a relatively early age, but many (38%) didn\u2019t have any formal education until adulthood. This figure jumps to 45% for Gen Z and 50% for millennials.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h3>Gen Z\u2019s Parents Taught Them About Personal Finance While Baby Boomers Taught Themselves&lt;/h3>\\r\\n&lt;p>Where did Americans learn about personal finance? Only a small number learned about personal finance from school (between 6% and 9% across all generations). A majority got their money management instruction from parents or were self-taught \u2014 but not everyone was.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;div id=\\&#34;datawrapper-vis-ioToD\\&#34;>&lt;img src=\\&#34;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ioToD/full.png\\&#34; alt=\\&#34;Where Did Americans Learn About Personal Finance?\\&#34; height=\\&#34;288\\&#34;>&lt;/div>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>47% of baby boomers were self-taught, and 39% learned from parents or guardians.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>37% of Gen X studied money management on their own, with 48% learning from their parents.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>31% of millennials taught themselves, and 52% learned from family members.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Only 11% of Gen Z taught themselves to manage their accounts, and 67% learned from their parents.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Baby boomers were most likely to learn by themselves. This makes sense, considering that the staggering majority of baby boomers (all but 7%) didn\u2019t regularly discuss money matters with family members.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Does the self-taught approach bring any lasting benefits? Today, older generations need to acquire digital financial literacy. Self-taught baby boomers and Gen X can apply the same individual learning skills they honed in their youth to master new computer or app-based money tools.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Americans Believe Their Past Led To a Positive Financial Future&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>Growing up, some Americans regularly discussed proactive money management. Others lived in homes where financial matters were seen as a source of stress and hardship. How did these different experiences affect their attitudes about money as adults?&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Overall, &lt;b>3 out of 4 say their upbringing positively impacted their current financial situation&lt;/b>. That figure was consistent across all generations, ranging from 70% to 79%.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>For 26% of Americans, spending is the most important financial habit inherited from family members. 23% said the same thing about saving and budgeting.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>When it comes to negative habits, there\u2019s actually a lot of consistency between generations. Roughly one-third of each generation has a habit of living from paycheck to paycheck and a significant fear of debt.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Though less common, things like avoiding financial decisions (8%) and foregoing financial planning (5%) also affect each generation.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Is Anyone Doing Better Financially Than Their Parents?&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>There are some stark differences between how members of each generation view their own financial situation in relation to that of their parents.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;div id=\\&#34;datawrapper-vis-PHyql\\&#34;>&lt;img src=\\&#34;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PHyql/full.png\\&#34; alt=\\&#34;Do Americans Believe They Are Doing Better Than Their Parents at the Same Age?\\&#34; height=\\&#34;276\\&#34;>&lt;/div>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>55% of baby boomers said they were better off than their parents were at the same age. 20% said they had achieved about the same level of financial success and stability, and 19% claimed they were worse off than their parents.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Only 33% of Gen X were better off financially than their parents. 25% were about the same, and 35% were worse off monetarily.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>37% of millennials said they were in a better position than their mother and father, 26% were about the same and 33% were worse off.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>41% of Gen Z said they were in a better place financially. 24% were about the same, and only 17% were worse off.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Gen X and millennials are the least likely to say they\u2019re better off, with Gen Z following closely. All of these generations have experienced financial challenges \u2014 like stagnant wages and &lt;a href=\\&#34;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/18/facts-about-student-loans/\\&#34; title=\\&#34;https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/18/facts-about-student-loans/\\&#34; target=\\&#34;_blank\\&#34;>rising student loan debt&lt;/a> \u2014 that haven\u2019t affected baby boomers to the same extent. This could be why baby boomers are more likely to claim they\u2019re doing better than previous generations.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>All that to say, while financial education and habits may have played a role, external factors also affected each generation\u2019s financial success. After all, a poor economy could have a significant effect on someone\u2019s finances regardless of how well their parents prepared them.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Majority of Gen Z Feels the Weight of Larger Financial Forces&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>How big of an impact did external factors, such as economic recessions, have on participants\u2019 financial experiences growing up?&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>Roughly two of three baby boomers&lt;/b> say outside factors influenced their financial upbringing.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>64% of Gen X&lt;/b> say the economy played a large role in their financial situation.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>69% of millennials&lt;/b> make the same claim.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>Nearly 3 out of 4 members of Gen Z&lt;/b> blame the economy for their financial development.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>This upward trend could be due to an increasing awareness in each subsequent generation of how the overall economy affected their family\u2019s finances. After all, &lt;b>65% of Americans&lt;/b> also believe their parents\u2019 decisions and habits were influenced by larger financial forces.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Gen Z and Women Experience the Most Financial Stress&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>What sort of emotions do Americans feel about their finances? Are people typically anxious or stressed about money? Are they more positive and empowered? Here\u2019s what we found:&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;div id=\\&#34;datawrapper-vis-BbYWD\\&#34;>&lt;img src=\\&#34;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BbYWD/full.png\\&#34; alt=\\&#34;What Sort of Emotions do Americans Feel About Their Finances?\\&#34; height=\\&#34;442\\&#34;>&lt;/div>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>29% of baby boomers said they felt anxiety or stress about their current financial situation. However, 61% primarily felt confidence or control over their money.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>54% of Gen X reported stress and anxiety, with only 33% saying they were confident or in control of their financial situation.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>51% of millennials admitted that they feel stressed about money, while 36% feel confident and in control.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>59% of Gen Z were stressed or anxious, with only 35% reporting feeling empowered financially.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>We also looked at the role of gender when it comes to emotional associations with money. 38% of male participants admitted to anxiety or stress, with 50% reporting confidence and control. On the other hand, &lt;b>48% of women feel financial stress&lt;/b>, while only 39% feel confident.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>The difference in confidence could be due to the wealth gap between men and women. Households with women as the primary earners had &lt;a href=\\&#34;https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/mar/gender-wealth-gap-never-married-adults-shrank\\&#34; title=\\&#34;https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/mar/gender-wealth-gap-never-married-adults-shrank\\&#34; target=\\&#34;_blank\\&#34;>55 cents of wealth&lt;/a> for every dollar in homes with male earners. Higher instances of stress in women are likely rooted in the challenge of having to work with much less than their male counterparts do.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Debt and Overdrafts Are Normal for Millennials&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>Certain generations are more likely to consider debt a normal part of their financial life than others:&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;div id=\\&#34;datawrapper-vis-eymzU\\&#34;>&lt;img src=\\&#34;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eymzU/full.png\\&#34; alt=\\&#34;Do Americans Consider Debt a Normal Part of Life?\\&#34; height=\\&#34;329\\&#34;>&lt;/div>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>35% of baby boomers thought debt was a normal part of their financial life based on family experiences growing up.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>50% of Gen X participants felt the same.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>48% of millennials thought debt was normal.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>39% of Gen Z responded in the same way.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Often, debt can arise due to improper &lt;a href=\\&#34;/credit-cards\\&#34; title=\\&#34;https://www.creditonebank.com/credit-cards\\&#34; target=\\&#34;_self\\&#34;>use of credit cards&lt;/a>. Collectively, Americans had approximately &lt;a href=\\&#34;https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc\\&#34; title=\\&#34;https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc\\&#34; target=\\&#34;_blank\\&#34;>$1.14 trillion&lt;/a> in credit card balances in mid-2024. While carrying a balance can lead to interest charges that increase overall debt, some people can manage their balances without experiencing snowballing debt.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Which generations had positive credit card management practices? We looked at the top two reasons why each group used credit cards.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Baby boomers used cards to maximize points and for convenience when making purchases.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Gen X used cards to access credit when cash wasn\u2019t available and for convenience.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Millennials used cards when they didn\u2019t have cash available and to &lt;a href=\\&#34;/credit-cards/platinum-visa-for-rebuilding-credit\\&#34; title=\\&#34;https://www.creditonebank.com/credit-cards/platinum-visa-for-rebuilding-credit\\&#34; target=\\&#34;_self\\&#34;>build their credit score&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Gen Z used cards to get points and boost their credit score.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Overdrafts are another indicator of debt and potential spending issues. We asked the different generations how often they\u2019d overdrawn accounts in the past year.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;div id=\\&#34;datawrapper-vis-IvZZT\\&#34;>&lt;img src=\\&#34;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IvZZT/full.png\\&#34; alt=\\&#34;How Many Times Have Americans Overdrafted Their Bank Accounts in the Past Year?\\&#34; height=\\&#34;383\\&#34;>&lt;/div>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>86% of baby boomers hadn\u2019t overdrawn and 10% had one or two overdrafts.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>66% of Gen X avoided overdrafts, with 19% having one or two and 9% reporting three overdrafts.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>54% of millennials didn\u2019t overdraw, with 28% doing so once or twice and 10% three times. 6% overdrew six to 10 times.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>61% of Gen Z avoided overextending their checking accounts. 26% had one or two overdrafts and 6% had three overdrafts.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Overall, younger generations are more likely to overdraw. Only 14% of baby boomers had any overdrafts, and 46% of millennials were drawing money they didn&#39;t have in their accounts.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Societal Norms Also Contribute to Financial Trauma&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>Society has a specific definition of financial success, which often involves steps like owning a home or having a savings account. These norms and expectations contribute to &lt;b>financial trauma for a whopping 57% of Americans&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>However, this perception is significantly different across generations. Only &lt;b>48% of baby boomers&lt;/b> feel this way, which is in stark contrast to &lt;b>72% of Gen Z&lt;/b>. Both Gen X (60%) and millennials (64%) were more middle of the road in comparison.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>It\u2019s clear that younger generations were more heavily impacted by societal norms compared to their older peers. Technology and social media may play a role, creating ever-present reminders of expectations and unrealistic depictions of financial success.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>The Biggest Barrier to Financial Stability? High Cost of Living&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>Attitudes about personal finance and money education vary across generations. However, all agree on the most significant barrier to financial stability today.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>38% of Americans believe the &lt;b>high cost of living is the biggest obstacle to achieving financial stability&lt;/b> today. This was the top answer for each generation, with percentages ranging from 37% to 41% for each group.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>This comes as no surprise, given how dramatically the cost of living has risen over the last few years alone. That\u2019s a financial pinch everyone can feel, regardless of their age.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Lack of income or job opportunities (18%) was the second most popular answer for all generations except baby boomers. 28% of boomers were more worried about economic factors like inflation. This perhaps pointed to their reliance on income from retirement accounts rather than wages.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Younger Americans Believe They Can Break the Cycle&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>Despite these hurdles, many younger Americans are optimistic about being able to overcome harmful attitudes or financial habits.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>How confident is each generation about overcoming negative lessons and habits learned during their younger years? Here\u2019s how each group rates themselves:&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;div id=\\&#34;datawrapper-vis-6pJLY\\&#34;>&lt;img src=\\&#34;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6pJLY/full.png\\&#34; alt=\\&#34;How Confident are Americans in Their Ability to Break Away From Inherited Financial Habits?\\&#34; height=\\&#34;314\\&#34;>&lt;/div>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Baby boomers were the most confident, with 44% claiming a high level of confidence and 92% feeling generally positive.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>Gen X was more tempered, with 23% reporting high confidence levels and 89% feeling highly or moderately confident.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>28% of millennials gave themselves the highest rating, and 91% said they were reasonably optimistic.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>33% of Gen Z respondents felt very confident. That number jumped to 93% when moderately confident survey-takers were included.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Baby boomers could have confidence from the experience and wealth they\u2019ve built up over the years. Younger generations may lack the job stability and experience of their older peers, but they have &lt;a href=\\&#34;https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2024/mar/where-gen-z-goes-for-financial-info\\&#34; title=\\&#34;https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2024/mar/where-gen-z-goes-for-financial-info\\&#34; target=\\&#34;_blank\\&#34;>access to technology and tools&lt;/a> that assist with financial management. Also, some have a safety net in the form of baby boomer parents who help them financially. Nearly half of Gen Z get such assistance from their mother or father.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;div id=\\&#34;datawrapper-vis-IVbqD\\&#34;>&lt;img src=\\&#34;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IVbqD/full.png\\&#34; alt=\\&#34;How Can Americans Develop Better Financial Habits?\\&#34; height=\\&#34;346\\&#34;>&lt;/div>\\r\\n&lt;p>When it comes to actually breaking the cycle of poor financial habits, Americans believe in the power of various solutions. &lt;b>Low-interest loans were the most popular choice overall (23% of respondents)&lt;/b>, and also the favorite option for each generation.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Other answers included accessible financial education (21%), personalized financial counseling, and target savings or investing (17% each).&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Americans also believe certain financial behaviors are best left in the past for the next generation to move forward:&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>Saving and budgeting strategies&lt;/b>: 27%;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>Investing for long-term security&lt;/b>: 23%;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>Spending habits and consumerism&lt;/b>: 21%&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;b>Financial education and literacy&lt;/b>: 13%.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>16% of Americans don\u2019t think anything needs to change for future generations to find financial success. One generation in particular holds this view: a staggering 27% of baby boomers. They\u2019re about &lt;b>three times more likely&lt;/b> to believe in the power of the status quo than Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h3>Americans Avoid Working With Financial Professionals, Despite Their Helpfulness&lt;/h3>\\r\\n&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&#34;,&#34;:type&#34;:&#34;cob-corp-acquisition/components/creditonebank/article-richtext&#34;},&#34;image_994891863&#34;:{&#34;marginDesktopLeft&#34;:&#34;0px&#34;,&#34;imageUrlDesktop&#34;:&#34;/content/dam/cob-corp-acquisition/images/articles/2025/01/CO-G1.png&#34;,&#34;imageUrlMobile&#34;:&#34;/content/dam/cob-corp-acquisition/images/articles/2025/01/CO-G1.png&#34;,&#34;imageCentered&#34;:true,&#34;imageBottomAligned&#34;:false,&#34;imageWidthDesktop&#34;:&#34;640px&#34;,&#34;lazyLoad&#34;:true,&#34;preloadDesktopImage&#34;:false,&#34;newTabLink&#34;:false,&#34;:type&#34;:&#34;cob-corp-acquisition/components/creditonebank/image&#34;},&#34;article_richtext_961018172&#34;:{&#34;sideImagePlacement&#34;:&#34;left&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Financial education and personalized counseling are important for everyone\u2019s financial well-being. Here\u2019s the generational breakdown of who\u2019s actually sought help in this area:&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;ul>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>19% of baby boomers;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>18% of Gen X;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>25% of millennials;&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;li>&lt;p>35% of Gen Z.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;/li>\\r\\n&lt;/ul>\\r\\n&lt;p>Younger generations are more likely to seek professional financial advice. However, a majority of all generations still avoid taking this step. Worries about cost and fears of being embarrassed due to a lack of assets are factors that keep people in the realm of do-it-yourself financial management.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>Younger generations may be more willing to communicate about money with family and seek professional help if they need it. People in every age group can struggle to deal with financial challenges like the high cost of living and to overcome the negative money habits and attitudes that they learned when growing up.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Methodology&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>For this survey, we asked 1,000 adults a series of questions about their financial history. The only qualification was that they had at least one credit card. We broke the participants down into four categories: baby boomers, Generation X, millennials, and Generation Z. This allowed us to compare the answers between generations to see how they differed.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;p>We asked a series of questions about how the participants learned about and experienced personal finance while growing up. We also inquired about their current financial situation, attitudes, and skills to see how their past experiences affected their current financial management efforts.&lt;/p>\\r\\n&lt;h2>Fair Use Policy&lt;/h2>\\r\\n&lt;p>Users are welcome to utilize the insights and findings from this study for noncommercial purposes, such as academic research, educational presentations, and personal reference.

However, these lessons differ between generations, based on the larger economic situation and what their parents learned in their own youth.

In fact, there are significant differences between generations in this area.</p><ul><li><p>73% of baby boomers began managing their own finances between age 18 and 24. Only 16% started overseeing their own accounts before 18.</p></li><li><p>59% of Gen X began managing their own bills between 18 and 24. A far higher number compared to baby boomers, 28%, started before age 18.</p></li><li><p>56% of millennials took over their accounts between 18 and 24; 23% took responsibility for their money before age 18.</p><ul><li><p>Surprisingly, 15% of millennials didn\u2019t start tracking their bills and budgets until they were between 25 and 30 years old.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>72% of Gen Z started managing their finances between the ages of 18 and 24, with only 17% starting before age 18.</p></li></ul><p>Most Americans started their money management responsibilities at a relatively early age, but many (38%) didn\u2019t have any formal education until adulthood. This figure jumps to 45% for Gen Z and 50% for millennials.</p><h3>Gen Z\u2019s Parents Taught Them About Personal Finance While Baby Boomers Taught Themselves</h3><p>Where did Americans learn about personal finance? Only a small number learned about personal finance from school (between 6% and 9% across all generations). A majority got their money management instruction from parents or were self-taught \u2014 but not everyone was.</p><p>\u00a0</p><div id=\"datawrapper-vis-ioToD\"><img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ioToD/full.png\" alt=\"Where Did Americans Learn About Personal Finance?\" height=\"288\"/></div><ul><li><p>47% of baby boomers were self-taught, and 39% learned from parents or guardians.</p></li><li><p>37% of Gen X studied money management on their own, with 48% learning from their parents.</p></li><li><p>31% of millennials taught themselves, and 52% learned from family members.</p></li><li><p>Only 11% of Gen Z taught themselves to manage their accounts, and 67% learned from their parents.</p></li></ul><p>Baby boomers were most likely to learn by themselves. This makes sense, considering that the staggering majority of baby boomers (all but 7%) didn\u2019t regularly discuss money matters with family members.</p><p>Does the self-taught approach bring any lasting benefits? Today, older generations need to acquire digital financial literacy. Self-taught baby boomers and Gen X can apply the same individual learning skills they honed in their youth to master new computer or app-based money tools.</p><h2>Americans Believe Their Past Led To a Positive Financial Future</h2><p>Growing up, some Americans regularly discussed proactive money management. Others lived in homes where financial matters were seen as a source of stress and hardship. How did these different experiences affect their attitudes about money as adults?</p><p>Overall, <b>3 out of 4 say their upbringing positively impacted their current financial situation</b>. That figure was consistent across all generations, ranging from 70% to 79%.</p><p>For 26% of Americans, spending is the most important financial habit inherited from family members. 23% said the same thing about saving and budgeting.</p><p>When it comes to negative habits, there\u2019s actually a lot of consistency between generations. Roughly one-third of each generation has a habit of living from paycheck to paycheck and a significant fear of debt.</p><p>Though less common, things like avoiding financial decisions (8%) and foregoing financial planning (5%) also affect each generation.</p><h2>Is Anyone Doing Better Financially Than Their Parents?</h2><p>There are some stark differences between how members of each generation view their own financial situation in relation to that of their parents.</p><p>\u00a0</p><div id=\"datawrapper-vis-PHyql\"><img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PHyql/full.png\" alt=\"Do Americans Believe They Are Doing Better Than Their Parents at the Same Age?\" height=\"276\"/></div><ul><li><p>55% of baby boomers said they were better off than their parents were at the same age. 20% said they had achieved about the same level of financial success and stability, and 19% claimed they were worse off than their parents.</p></li><li><p>Only 33% of Gen X were better off financially than their parents. 25% were about the same, and 35% were worse off monetarily.</p></li><li><p>37% of millennials said they were in a better position than their mother and father, 26% were about the same and 33% were worse off.</p></li><li><p>41% of Gen Z said they were in a better place financially. 24% were about the same, and only 17% were worse off.</p></li></ul><p>Gen X and millennials are the least likely to say they\u2019re better off, with Gen Z following closely. All of these generations have experienced financial challenges \u2014 like stagnant wages and <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/18/facts-about-student-loans/\" title=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/18/facts-about-student-loans/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"undefined Speedbump\">rising student loan debt</a> \u2014 that haven\u2019t affected baby boomers to the same extent. This could be why baby boomers are more likely to claim they\u2019re doing better than previous generations.</p><p>All that to say, while financial education and habits may have played a role, external factors also affected each generation\u2019s financial success. After all, a poor economy could have a significant effect on someone\u2019s finances regardless of how well their parents prepared them.</p><h2>Majority of Gen Z Feels the Weight of Larger Financial Forces</h2><p>How big of an impact did external factors, such as economic recessions, have on participants\u2019 financial experiences growing up?</p><ul><li><p><b>Roughly two of three baby boomers</b> say outside factors influenced their financial upbringing.</p></li><li><p><b>64% of Gen X</b> say the economy played a large role in their financial situation.</p></li><li><p><b>69% of millennials</b> make the same claim.</p></li><li><p><b>Nearly 3 out of 4 members of Gen Z</b> blame the economy for their financial development.</p></li></ul><p>This upward trend could be due to an increasing awareness in each subsequent generation of how the overall economy affected their family\u2019s finances. After all, <b>65% of Americans</b> also believe their parents\u2019 decisions and habits were influenced by larger financial forces.</p><h2>Gen Z and Women Experience the Most Financial Stress</h2><p>What sort of emotions do Americans feel about their finances? Are people typically anxious or stressed about money? Are they more positive and empowered? Here\u2019s what we found:</p><p>\u00a0</p><div id=\"datawrapper-vis-BbYWD\"><img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BbYWD/full.png\" alt=\"What Sort of Emotions do Americans Feel About Their Finances?\" height=\"442\"/></div><ul><li><p>29% of baby boomers said they felt anxiety or stress about their current financial situation. However, 61% primarily felt confidence or control over their money.</p></li><li><p>54% of Gen X reported stress and anxiety, with only 33% saying they were confident or in control of their financial situation.</p></li><li><p>51% of millennials admitted that they feel stressed about money, while 36% feel confident and in control.</p></li><li><p>59% of Gen Z were stressed or anxious, with only 35% reporting feeling empowered financially.</p></li></ul><p>We also looked at the role of gender when it comes to emotional associations with money. 38% of male participants admitted to anxiety or stress, with 50% reporting confidence and control. On the other hand, <b>48% of women feel financial stress</b>, while only 39% feel confident.</p><p>The difference in confidence could be due to the wealth gap between men and women. Households with women as the primary earners had <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/mar/gender-wealth-gap-never-married-adults-shrank\" title=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/mar/gender-wealth-gap-never-married-adults-shrank\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"undefined Speedbump\">55 cents of wealth</a> for every dollar in homes with male earners. Higher instances of stress in women are likely rooted in the challenge of having to work with much less than their male counterparts do.</p><h2>Debt and Overdrafts Are Normal for Millennials</h2><p>Certain generations are more likely to consider debt a normal part of their financial life than others:</p><p>\u00a0</p><div id=\"datawrapper-vis-eymzU\"><img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eymzU/full.png\" alt=\"Do Americans Consider Debt a Normal Part of Life?\" height=\"329\"/></div><ul><li><p>35% of baby boomers thought debt was a normal part of their financial life based on family experiences growing up.</p></li><li><p>50% of Gen X participants felt the same.</p></li><li><p>48% of millennials thought debt was normal.</p></li><li><p>39% of Gen Z responded in the same way.</p></li></ul><p>Often, debt can arise due to improper <a href=\"/credit-cards\" title=\"https://www.creditonebank.com/credit-cards\" target=\"_self\">use of credit cards</a>. Collectively, Americans had approximately <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc\" title=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"undefined Speedbump\">$1.14 trillion</a> in credit card balances in mid-2024. While carrying a balance can lead to interest charges that increase overall debt, some people can manage their balances without experiencing snowballing debt.</p><p>Which generations had positive credit card management practices? We looked at the top two reasons why each group used credit cards.</p><ul><li><p>Baby boomers used cards to maximize points and for convenience when making purchases.</p></li><li><p>Gen X used cards to access credit when cash wasn\u2019t available and for convenience.</p></li><li><p>Millennials used cards when they didn\u2019t have cash available and to <a href=\"/credit-cards/platinum-visa-for-rebuilding-credit\" title=\"https://www.creditonebank.com/credit-cards/platinum-visa-for-rebuilding-credit\" target=\"_self\">build their credit score</a>.</p></li><li><p>Gen Z used cards to get points and boost their credit score.</p></li></ul><p>Overdrafts are another indicator of debt and potential spending issues. We asked the different generations how often they\u2019d overdrawn accounts in the past year.</p><p>\u00a0</p><div id=\"datawrapper-vis-IvZZT\"><img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IvZZT/full.png\" alt=\"How Many Times Have Americans Overdrafted Their Bank Accounts in the Past Year?\" height=\"383\"/></div><ul><li><p>86% of baby boomers hadn\u2019t overdrawn and 10% had one or two overdrafts.</p></li><li><p>66% of Gen X avoided overdrafts, with 19% having one or two and 9% reporting three overdrafts.</p></li><li><p>54% of millennials didn\u2019t overdraw, with 28% doing so once or twice and 10% three times. 6% overdrew six to 10 times.</p></li><li><p>61% of Gen Z avoided overextending their checking accounts. 26% had one or two overdrafts and 6% had three overdrafts.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, younger generations are more likely to overdraw. Only 14% of baby boomers had any overdrafts, and 46% of millennials were drawing money they didn&#x27;t have in their accounts.</p><h2>Societal Norms Also Contribute to Financial Trauma</h2><p>Society has a specific definition of financial success, which often involves steps like owning a home or having a savings account. These norms and expectations contribute to <b>financial trauma for a whopping 57% of Americans</b>.</p><p>However, this perception is significantly different across generations. Only <b>48% of baby boomers</b> feel this way, which is in stark contrast to <b>72% of Gen Z</b>. Both Gen X (60%) and millennials (64%) were more middle of the road in comparison.</p><p>It\u2019s clear that younger generations were more heavily impacted by societal norms compared to their older peers. Technology and social media may play a role, creating ever-present reminders of expectations and unrealistic depictions of financial success.</p><h2>The Biggest Barrier to Financial Stability? High Cost of Living</h2><p>Attitudes about personal finance and money education vary across generations. However, all agree on the most significant barrier to financial stability today.</p><p>38% of Americans believe the <b>high cost of living is the biggest obstacle to achieving financial stability</b> today. This was the top answer for each generation, with percentages ranging from 37% to 41% for each group.</p><p>This comes as no surprise, given how dramatically the cost of living has risen over the last few years alone. That\u2019s a financial pinch everyone can feel, regardless of their age.</p><p>Lack of income or job opportunities (18%) was the second most popular answer for all generations except baby boomers. 28% of boomers were more worried about economic factors like inflation. This perhaps pointed to their reliance on income from retirement accounts rather than wages.</p><h2>Younger Americans Believe They Can Break the Cycle</h2><p>Despite these hurdles, many younger Americans are optimistic about being able to overcome harmful attitudes or financial habits.</p><p>How confident is each generation about overcoming negative lessons and habits learned during their younger years? Here\u2019s how each group rates themselves:</p><p>\u00a0</p><div id=\"datawrapper-vis-6pJLY\"><img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6pJLY/full.png\" alt=\"How Confident are Americans in Their Ability to Break Away From Inherited Financial Habits?\" height=\"314\"/></div><ul><li><p>Baby boomers were the most confident, with 44% claiming a high level of confidence and 92% feeling generally positive.</p></li><li><p>Gen X was more tempered, with 23% reporting high confidence levels and 89% feeling highly or moderately confident.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>28% of millennials gave themselves the highest rating, and 91% said they were reasonably optimistic.</p></li><li><p>33% of Gen Z respondents felt very confident. That number jumped to 93% when moderately confident survey-takers were included.</p></li></ul><p>Baby boomers could have confidence from the experience and wealth they\u2019ve built up over the years. Younger generations may lack the job stability and experience of their older peers, but they have <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2024/mar/where-gen-z-goes-for-financial-info\" title=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2024/mar/where-gen-z-goes-for-financial-info\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"undefined Speedbump\">access to technology and tools</a> that assist with financial management. Also, some have a safety net in the form of baby boomer parents who help them financially. Nearly half of Gen Z get such assistance from their mother or father.</p><p>\u00a0</p><div id=\"datawrapper-vis-IVbqD\"><img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IVbqD/full.png\" alt=\"How Can Americans Develop Better Financial Habits?\" height=\"346\"/></div><p>When it comes to actually breaking the cycle of poor financial habits, Americans believe in the power of various solutions. <b>Low-interest loans were the most popular choice overall (23% of respondents)</b>, and also the favorite option for each generation.</p><p>Other answers included accessible financial education (21%), personalized financial counseling, and target savings or investing (17% each).</p><p>Americans also believe certain financial behaviors are best left in the past for the next generation to move forward:</p><ul><li><p><b>Saving and budgeting strategies</b>: 27%;</p></li><li><p><b>Investing for long-term security</b>: 23%;</p></li><li><p><b>Spending habits and consumerism</b>: 21%</p></li><li><p><b>Financial education and literacy</b>: 13%.</p></li></ul><p>16% of Americans don\u2019t think anything needs to change for future generations to find financial success. One generation in particular holds this view: a staggering 27% of baby boomers. They\u2019re about <b>three times more likely</b> to believe in the power of the status quo than Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z.</p><h3>Americans Avoid Working With Financial Professionals, Despite Their Helpfulness</h3><p>\u00a0</p></div></div><div></div></div><div class=\"\"><div id=\"image-component\" class=\"ImageComponent\"><div class=\"ImageComponent__container\"><div class=\"ImageComponent__container__content--centered\"><img class=\" \" src=\"/content/dam/cob-corp-acquisition/images/articles/2025/01/CO-G1.png\" loading=\"lazy\" fetchpriority=\"high\"/></div></div></div><div></div></div><div class=\"\"><div id=\"article-rich-text\" class=\"ArticleRichtext\"><div class=\"ArticleRichtext__text\"><p>\u00a0</p><p>Financial education and personalized counseling are important for everyone\u2019s financial well-being. Here\u2019s the generational breakdown of who\u2019s actually sought help in this area:</p><ul><li><p>19% of baby boomers;</p></li><li><p>18% of Gen X;</p></li><li><p>25% of millennials;</p></li><li><p>35% of Gen Z.</p></li></ul><p>Younger generations are more likely to seek professional financial advice. However, a majority of all generations still avoid taking this step. Worries about cost and fears of being embarrassed due to a lack of assets are factors that keep people in the realm of do-it-yourself financial management.</p><p>Younger generations may be more willing to communicate about money with family and seek professional help if they need it. People in every age group can struggle to deal with financial challenges like the high cost of living and to overcome the negative money habits and attitudes that they learned when growing up.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>For this survey, we asked 1,000 adults a series of questions about their financial history. The only qualification was that they had at least one credit card. We broke the participants down into four categories: baby boomers, Generation X, millennials, and Generation Z. This allowed us to compare the answers between generations to see how they differed.</p><p>We asked a series of questions about how the participants learned about and experienced personal finance while growing up. We also inquired about their current financial situation, attitudes, and skills to see how their past experiences affected their current financial management efforts.</p><h2>Fair Use Policy</h2><p>Users are welcome to utilize the insights and findings from this study for noncommercial purposes, such as academic research, educational presentations, and personal reference.

They can affect how people handle paycheck\ndeposits , savings accounts , bills, and credit cards well into adulthood. However,\nthese lessons differ between generations, based on the larger economic situation and\nwhat their parents learned in their own youth. Thats why we surveyed 1,000 Americans:\nto get an in-depth look at the financial habits, traumas, and attitudes each\ngeneration developed during their formative years. Key Findings Heres what we\ndiscovered about each generation's relationship with money: The high cost of living\nis the biggest financial barrier across generations. Only 19% of baby boomers and 17%\nof Gen Z feel financially worse off than their parents, compared to 35% of Gen X and\n33% of millennials. Baby boomers (65%) rarely or never discussed finances during\ntheir upbringing, whereas 30% of Gen Z frequently did. Millennials (53%) and Gen Z\n(50%) discuss investing and retirement more than Gen X (36%) or baby boomers (28%),\nreflecting younger generations' focus on financial growth. Lack of financial\neducation affects all generations  including 54% of Gen Z and 67% of baby boomers\nbut Gen Z faces greater anxiety (59%) than boomers (29%). Gen Z (35%) are more likely\nthan baby boomers (12%) to discuss finances only during stress, reflecting a reactive\napproach to money management. Young Americans Are Having Open Conversations About\nMoney Each generation has become increasingly more open about discussing money with\ntheir family.  Only 7% of baby boomers always discussed finances with their family\nwhile growing up. However, 65% rarely or never discussed money in their formative\nyears. 13% of Gen X always talked about money as children, but a majority (51%)\nrarely or never did. 23% of millennials conferred with parents about money all the\ntime, with 39% rarely or never having such talks. 30% of Gen Z always talked about\nmoney with family, while 36% said they rarely did. Boomers and Gen X grew up in a\nsociety that valued independence and self-sufficiency. However, changing norms and\nthe adoption of social media allowed younger generations to express themselves more\nopenly and easily. These dynamics helped Gen Z feel comfortable communicating about\ndifficult topics like personal finance. This openness extends to conversations about\ninvesting, retirement planning, and long-term financial aims. This topic was also\nmore common among younger generations:  28% of baby boomers; 36% of Gen X; 53% of\nmillennials; 50% of Gen Z. Finally, theres a link between stress and money\ndiscussions in most generations, except baby boomers. A significant minority only\ndiscussed money with family during times of financial hardship or money\ndisagreements:   12% of baby boomers; 26% of Gen X; 25% of millennials; And 35% of\nGen Z. Those who grew up seeing money as more stressful could develop a more anxious\nattitude when it comes to money matters.  Not everyone takes on responsibility for\ntheir finances once they hit adulthood. In fact, there are significant differences\nbetween generations in this area. 73% of baby boomers began managing their own\nfinances between age 18 and 24. Only 16% started overseeing their own accounts before\n18. 59% of Gen X began managing their own bills between 18 and 24. A far higher\nnumber compared to baby boomers, 28%, started before age 18. 56% of millennials took\nover their accounts between 18 and 24; 23% took responsibility for their money before\nage 18. Surprisingly, 15% of millennials didnt start tracking their bills and budgets\nuntil they were between 25 and 30 years old. 72% of Gen Z started managing their\nfinances between the ages of 18 and 24, with only 17% starting before age 18. Most\nAmericans started their money management responsibilities at a relatively early age,\nbut many (38%) didnt have any formal education until adulthood. This figure jumps to\n45% for Gen Z and 50% for millennials. Gen Zs Parents Taught Them About Personal\nFinance While Baby Boomers Taught Themselves Where did Americans learn about personal\nfinance? Only a small number learned about personal finance from school (between 6%\nand 9% across all generations). A majority got their money management instruction\nfrom parents or were self-taught  but not everyone was.  47% of baby boomers were\nself-taught, and 39% learned from parents or guardians. 37% of Gen X studied money\nmanagement on their own, with 48% learning from their parents. 31% of millennials\ntaught themselves, and 52% learned from family members. Only 11% of Gen Z taught\nthemselves to manage their accounts, and 67% learned from their parents. Baby boomers\nwere most likely to learn by themselves. This makes sense, considering that the\nstaggering majority of baby boomers (all but 7%) didnt regularly discuss money\nmatters with family members. Does the self-taught approach bring any lasting\nbenefits? Today, older generations need to acquire digital financial literacy. Self-\ntaught baby boomers and Gen X can apply the same individual learning skills they\nhoned in their youth to master new computer or app-based money tools. Americans\nBelieve Their Past Led To a Positive Financial Future Growing up, some Americans\nregularly discussed proactive money management. Others lived in homes where financial\nmatters were seen as a source of stress and hardship. How did these different\nexperiences affect their attitudes about money as adults? Overall, 3 out of 4 say\ntheir upbringing positively impacted their current financial situation . That figure\nwas consistent across all generations, ranging from 70% to 79%. For 26% of Americans,\nspending is the most important financial habit inherited from family members. 23%\nsaid the same thing about saving and budgeting. When it comes to negative habits,\ntheres actually a lot of consistency between generations. Roughly one-third of each\n", "2": "generation has a habit of living from paycheck to paycheck and a significant fear of\ndebt. Though less common, things like avoiding financial decisions (8%) and foregoing\nfinancial planning (5%) also affect each generation. Is Anyone Doing Better\nFinancially Than Their Parents? There are some stark differences between how members\nof each generation view their own financial situation in relation to that of their\nparents.  55% of baby boomers said they were better off than their parents were at\nthe same age. 20% said they had achieved about the same level of financial success\nand stability, and 19% claimed they were worse off than their parents. Only 33% of\nGen X were better off financially than their parents. 25% were about the same, and\n35% were worse off monetarily. 37% of millennials said they were in a better position\nthan their mother and father, 26% were about the same and 33% were worse off. 41% of\nGen Z said they were in a better place financially. 24% were about the same, and only\n17% were worse off. Gen X and millennials are the least likely to say theyre better\noff, with Gen Z following closely. All of these generations have experienced\nfinancial challenges  like stagnant wages and rising student loan debt  that havent\naffected baby boomers to the same extent. This could be why baby boomers are more\nlikely to claim theyre doing better than previous generations. All that to say, while\nfinancial education and habits may have played a role, external factors also affected\neach generations financial success. After all, a poor economy could have a\nsignificant effect on someones finances regardless of how well their parents prepared\nthem. Majority of Gen Z Feels the Weight of Larger Financial Forces How big of an\nimpact did external factors, such as economic recessions, have on participants\nfinancial experiences growing up? Roughly two of three baby boomers say outside\nfactors influenced their financial upbringing. 64% of Gen X say the economy played a\nlarge role in their financial situation. 69% of millennials make the same claim.\nNearly 3 out of 4 members of Gen Z blame the economy for their financial development.\nThis upward trend could be due to an increasing awareness in each subsequent\ngeneration of how the overall economy affected their familys finances. After all, 65%\nof Americans also believe their parents decisions and habits were influenced by\nlarger financial forces. Gen Z and Women Experience the Most Financial Stress What\nsort of emotions do Americans feel about their finances? Are people typically anxious\nor stressed about money? Are they more positive and empowered? Heres what we found:\n29% of baby boomers said they felt anxiety or stress about their current financial\nsituation. However, 61% primarily felt confidence or control over their money. 54% of\nGen X reported stress and anxiety, with only 33% saying they were confident or in\ncontrol of their financial situation. 51% of millennials admitted that they feel\nstressed about money, while 36% feel confident and in control. 59% of Gen Z were\nstressed or anxious, with only 35% reporting feeling empowered financially. We also\nlooked at the role of gender when it comes to emotional associations with money. 38%\nof male participants admitted to anxiety or stress, with 50% reporting confidence and\ncontrol. On the other hand, 48% of women feel financial stress , while only 39% feel\nconfident. The difference in confidence could be due to the wealth gap between men\nand women. Households with women as the primary earners had 55 cents of wealth for\nevery dollar in homes with male earners. Higher instances of stress in women are\nlikely rooted in the challenge of having to work with much less than their male\ncounterparts do. Debt and Overdrafts Are Normal for Millennials Certain generations\nare more likely to consider debt a normal part of their financial life than others:\n35% of baby boomers thought debt was a normal part of their financial life based on\nfamily experiences growing up. 50% of Gen X participants felt the same. 48% of\nmillennials thought debt was normal. 39% of Gen Z responded in the same way. Often,\ndebt can arise due to improper use of credit cards . Collectively, Americans had\napproximately $1.14 trillion in credit card balances in mid-2024. While carrying a\nbalance can lead to interest charges that increase overall debt, some people can\nmanage their balances without experiencing snowballing debt. Which generations had\npositive credit card management practices? We looked at the top two reasons why each\ngroup used credit cards. Baby boomers used cards to maximize points and for\nconvenience when making purchases. Gen X used cards to access credit when cash wasnt\navailable and for convenience. Millennials used cards when they didnt have cash\navailable and to build their credit score . Gen Z used cards to get points and boost\ntheir credit score. Overdrafts are another indicator of debt and potential spending\nissues. We asked the different generations how often theyd overdrawn accounts in the\npast year.  86% of baby boomers hadnt overdrawn and 10% had one or two overdrafts.\n66% of Gen X avoided overdrafts, with 19% having one or two and 9% reporting three\noverdrafts. 54% of millennials didnt overdraw, with 28% doing so once or twice and\n10% three times. 6% overdrew six to 10 times. 61% of Gen Z avoided overextending\ntheir checking accounts. 26% had one or two overdrafts and 6% had three overdrafts.\nOverall, younger generations are more likely to overdraw. Only 14% of baby boomers\nhad any overdrafts, and 46% of millennials were drawing money they didn't have in\ntheir accounts. Societal Norms Also Contribute to Financial Trauma Society has a\nspecific definition of financial success, which often involves steps like owning a\nhome or having a savings account. These norms and expectations contribute to\nfinancial trauma for a whopping 57% of Americans . However, this perception is\nsignificantly different across generations. Only 48% of baby boomers feel this way,\nwhich is in stark contrast to 72% of Gen Z . Both Gen X (60%) and millennials (64%)\nwere more middle of the road in comparison. Its clear that younger generations were\nmore heavily impacted by societal norms compared to their older peers. Technology and\nsocial media may play a role, creating ever-present reminders of expectations and\nunrealistic depictions of financial success. The Biggest Barrier to Financial\nStability? High Cost of Living Attitudes about personal finance and money education\n", "3": "vary across generations. However, all agree on the most significant barrier to\nfinancial stability today. 38% of Americans believe the high cost of living is the\nbiggest obstacle to achieving financial stability today. This was the top answer for\neach generation, with percentages ranging from 37% to 41% for each group. This comes\nas no surprise, given how dramatically the cost of living has risen over the last few\nyears alone. Thats a financial pinch everyone can feel, regardless of their age. Lack\nof income or job opportunities (18%) was the second most popular answer for all\ngenerations except baby boomers. 28% of boomers were more worried about economic\nfactors like inflation. This perhaps pointed to their reliance on income from\nretirement accounts rather than wages. Younger Americans Believe They Can Break the\nCycle Despite these hurdles, many younger Americans are optimistic about being able\nto overcome harmful attitudes or financial habits. How confident is each generation\nabout overcoming negative lessons and habits learned during their younger years?\nHeres how each group rates themselves:  Baby boomers were the most confident, with\n44% claiming a high level of confidence and 92% feeling generally positive. Gen X was\nmore tempered, with 23% reporting high confidence levels and 89% feeling highly or\nmoderately confident. 28% of millennials gave themselves the highest rating, and 91%\nsaid they were reasonably optimistic. 33% of Gen Z respondents felt very confident.\nThat number jumped to 93% when moderately confident survey-takers were included. Baby\nboomers could have confidence from the experience and wealth theyve built up over the\nyears. Younger generations may lack the job stability and experience of their older\npeers, but they have access to technology and tools that assist with financial\nmanagement. Also, some have a safety net in the form of baby boomer parents who help\nthem financially. Nearly half of Gen Z get such assistance from their mother or\nfather.  When it comes to actually breaking the cycle of poor financial habits,\nAmericans believe in the power of various solutions. Low-interest loans were the most\npopular choice overall (23% of respondents) , and also the favorite option for each\ngeneration. Other answers included accessible financial education (21%), personalized\nfinancial counseling, and target savings or investing (17% each). Americans also\nbelieve certain financial behaviors are best left in the past for the next generation\nto move forward: Saving and budgeting strategies : 27%; Investing for long-term\nsecurity : 23%; Spending habits and consumerism : 21% Financial education and\nliteracy : 13%. 16% of Americans dont think anything needs to change for future\ngenerations to find financial success. One generation in particular holds this view:\na staggering 27% of baby boomers. Theyre about three times more likely to believe in\nthe power of the status quo than Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z. Americans Avoid\nWorking With Financial Professionals, Despite Their Helpfulness   Financial education\nand personalized counseling are important for everyones financial well-being. Heres\nthe generational breakdown of whos actually sought help in this area: 19% of baby\nboomers; 18% of Gen X; 25% of millennials; 35% of Gen Z. Younger generations are more\nlikely to seek professional financial advice. However, a majority of all generations\nstill avoid taking this step. Worries about cost and fears of being embarrassed due\nto a lack of assets are factors that keep people in the realm of do-it-yourself\nfinancial management. Younger generations may be more willing to communicate about\nmoney with family and seek professional help if they need it. People in every age\ngroup can struggle to deal with financial challenges like the high cost of living and\nto overcome the negative money habits and attitudes that they learned when growing\nup. Methodology For this survey, we asked 1,000 adults a series of questions about\ntheir financial history. The only qualification was that they had at least one credit\ncard. We broke the participants down into four categories: baby boomers, Generation\nX, millennials, and Generation Z. This allowed us to compare the answers between\ngenerations to see how they differed. We asked a series of questions about how the\nparticipants learned about and experienced personal finance while growing up. We also\ninquired about their current financial situation, attitudes, and skills to see how\ntheir past experiences affected their current financial management efforts.

They can affect how people handle paycheck\ndeposits , savings accounts , bills, and credit cards well into adulthood. However,\nthese lessons differ between generations, based on the larger economic situation and\nwhat their parents learned in their own youth. Thats why we surveyed 1,000 Americans:\nto get an in-depth look at the financial habits, traumas, and attitudes each\ngeneration developed during their formative years. Key Findings Heres what we\ndiscovered about each generation's relationship with money: The high cost of living\nis the biggest financial barrier across generations. Only 19% of baby boomers and 17%\nof Gen Z feel financially worse off than their parents, compared to 35% of Gen X and\n33% of millennials. Baby boomers (65%) rarely or never discussed finances during\ntheir upbringing, whereas 30% of Gen Z frequently did. Millennials (53%) and Gen Z\n(50%) discuss investing and retirement more than Gen X (36%) or baby boomers (28%),\nreflecting younger generations' focus on financial growth. Lack of financial\neducation affects all generations  including 54% of Gen Z and 67% of baby boomers\nbut Gen Z faces greater anxiety (59%) than boomers (29%). Gen Z (35%) are more likely\nthan baby boomers (12%) to discuss finances only during stress, reflecting a reactive\napproach to money management. Young Americans Are Having Open Conversations About\nMoney Each generation has become increasingly more open about discussing money with\ntheir family.  Only 7% of baby boomers always discussed finances with their family\nwhile growing up. However, 65% rarely or never discussed money in their formative\nyears. 13% of Gen X always talked about money as children, but a majority (51%)\nrarely or never did. 23% of millennials conferred with parents about money all the\ntime, with 39% rarely or never having such talks. 30% of Gen Z always talked about\nmoney with family, while 36% said they rarely did. Boomers and Gen X grew up in a\nsociety that valued independence and self-sufficiency. However, changing norms and\nthe adoption of social media allowed younger generations to express themselves more\nopenly and easily. These dynamics helped Gen Z feel comfortable communicating about\ndifficult topics like personal finance. This openness extends to conversations about\ninvesting, retirement planning, and long-term financial aims. This topic was also\nmore common among younger generations:  28% of baby boomers; 36% of Gen X; 53% of\nmillennials; 50% of Gen Z. Finally, theres a link between stress and money\ndiscussions in most generations, except baby boomers. A significant minority only\ndiscussed money with family during times of financial hardship or money\ndisagreements:   12% of baby boomers; 26% of Gen X; 25% of millennials; And 35% of\nGen Z. Those who grew up seeing money as more stressful could develop a more anxious\nattitude when it comes to money matters.  Not everyone takes on responsibility for\ntheir finances once they hit adulthood. In fact, there are significant differences\nbetween generations in this area. 73% of baby boomers began managing their own\nfinances between age 18 and 24. Only 16% started overseeing their own accounts before\n18. 59% of Gen X began managing their own bills between 18 and 24. A far higher\nnumber compared to baby boomers, 28%, started before age 18. 56% of millennials took\nover their accounts between 18 and 24; 23% took responsibility for their money before\nage 18. Surprisingly, 15% of millennials didnt start tracking their bills and budgets\nuntil they were between 25 and 30 years old. 72% of Gen Z started managing their\nfinances between the ages of 18 and 24, with only 17% starting before age 18. Most\nAmericans started their money management responsibilities at a relatively early age,\nbut many (38%) didnt have any formal education until adulthood. This figure jumps to\n45% for Gen Z and 50% for millennials. Gen Zs Parents Taught Them About Personal\nFinance While Baby Boomers Taught Themselves Where did Americans learn about personal\nfinance? Only a small number learned about personal finance from school (between 6%\nand 9% across all generations). A majority got their money management instruction\nfrom parents or were self-taught  but not everyone was.  47% of baby boomers were\nself-taught, and 39% learned from parents or guardians. 37% of Gen X studied money\nmanagement on their own, with 48% learning from their parents. 31% of millennials\ntaught themselves, and 52% learned from family members. Only 11% of Gen Z taught\nthemselves to manage their accounts, and 67% learned from their parents. Baby boomers\nwere most likely to learn by themselves. This makes sense, considering that the\nstaggering majority of baby boomers (all but 7%) didnt regularly discuss money\nmatters with family members. Does the self-taught approach bring any lasting\nbenefits? Today, older generations need to acquire digital financial literacy. Self-\ntaught baby boomers and Gen X can apply the same individual learning skills they\nhoned in their youth to master new computer or app-based money tools. Americans\nBelieve Their Past Led To a Positive Financial Future Growing up, some Americans\nregularly discussed proactive money management. Others lived in homes where financial\nmatters were seen as a source of stress and hardship. How did these different\nexperiences affect their attitudes about money as adults? Overall, 3 out of 4 say\ntheir upbringing positively impacted their current financial situation . That figure\nwas consistent across all generations, ranging from 70% to 79%. For 26% of Americans,\nspending is the most important financial habit inherited from family members. 23%\nsaid the same thing about saving and budgeting. When it comes to negative habits,\ntheres actually a lot of consistency between generations. Roughly one-third of each\ngeneration has a habit of living from paycheck to paycheck and a significant fear of\ndebt. Though less common, things like avoiding financial decisions (8%) and foregoing\nfinancial planning (5%) also affect each generation. Is Anyone Doing Better\nFinancially Than Their Parents? There are some stark differences between how members\nof each generation view their own financial situation in relation to that of their\nparents.  55% of baby boomers said they were better off than their parents were at\nthe same age. 20% said they had achieved about the same level of financial success\nand stability, and 19% claimed they were worse off than their parents. Only 33% of\nGen X were better off financially than their parents. 25% were about the same, and\n35% were worse off monetarily. 37% of millennials said they were in a better position\nthan their mother and father, 26% were about the same and 33% were worse off. 41% of\nGen Z said they were in a better place financially. 24% were about the same, and only\n17% were worse off. Gen X and millennials are the least likely to say theyre better\noff, with Gen Z following closely. All of these generations have experienced\nfinancial challenges  like stagnant wages and rising student loan debt  that havent\naffected baby boomers to the same extent. This could be why baby boomers are more\nlikely to claim theyre doing better than previous generations. All that to say, while\nfinancial education and habits may have played a role, external factors also affected\neach generations financial success. After all, a poor economy could have a\nsignificant effect on someones finances regardless of how well their parents prepared\nthem. Majority of Gen Z Feels the Weight of Larger Financial Forces How big of an\nimpact did external factors, such as economic recessions, have on participants\nfinancial experiences growing up? Roughly two of three baby boomers say outside\nfactors influenced their financial upbringing. 64% of Gen X say the economy played a\nlarge role in their financial situation. 69% of millennials make the same claim.\nNearly 3 out of 4 members of Gen Z blame the economy for their financial development.\nThis upward trend could be due to an increasing awareness in each subsequent\ngeneration of how the overall economy affected their familys finances. After all, 65%\nof Americans also believe their parents decisions and habits were influenced by\nlarger financial forces. Gen Z and Women Experience the Most Financial Stress What\nsort of emotions do Americans feel about their finances? Are people typically anxious\nor stressed about money? Are they more positive and empowered? Heres what we found:\n29% of baby boomers said they felt anxiety or stress about their current financial\nsituation. However, 61% primarily felt confidence or control over their money. 54% of\nGen X reported stress and anxiety, with only 33% saying they were confident or in\ncontrol of their financial situation. 51% of millennials admitted that they feel\nstressed about money, while 36% feel confident and in control. 59% of Gen Z were\nstressed or anxious, with only 35% reporting feeling empowered financially. We also\nlooked at the role of gender when it comes to emotional associations with money. 38%\nof male participants admitted to anxiety or stress, with 50% reporting confidence and\ncontrol. On the other hand, 48% of women feel financial stress , while only 39% feel\nconfident. The difference in confidence could be due to the wealth gap between men\nand women. Households with women as the primary earners had 55 cents of wealth for\nevery dollar in homes with male earners. Higher instances of stress in women are\nlikely rooted in the challenge of having to work with much less than their male\ncounterparts do. Debt and Overdrafts Are Normal for Millennials Certain generations\nare more likely to consider debt a normal part of their financial life than others:\n35% of baby boomers thought debt was a normal part of their financial life based on\nfamily experiences growing up. 50% of Gen X participants felt the same. 48% of\nmillennials thought debt was normal. 39% of Gen Z responded in the same way.

Only 14% of baby boomers\nhad any overdrafts, and 46% of millennials were drawing money they didn't have in\ntheir accounts. Societal Norms Also Contribute to Financial Trauma Society has a\nspecific definition of financial success, which often involves steps like owning a\nhome or having a savings account.

Only 11% of Gen Z taught themselves to manage their accounts, and 67% learned from their parents. Baby boomers were most likely to learn by themselves. This makes sense, considering that the staggering majority of baby boomers (all but 7%) didnt regularly discuss money matters with family members. Does the self-taught approach bring any lasting benefits? Today, older generations need to acquire digital financial literacy. Selftaught baby boomers and Gen X can apply the same individual learning skills they honed in their youth to master new computer or app-based money tools. Americans Believe Their Past Led To a Positive Financial Future Growing up, some Americans regularly discussed proactive money management. Others lived in homes where financial matters were seen as a source of stress and hardship. How did these different experiences affect their attitudes about money as adults? Overall, 3 out of 4 say their upbringing positively impacted their current financial situation . That figure was consistent across all generations, ranging from 70% to 79%. For 26% of Americans, spending is the most important financial habit inherited from family members. 23% said the same thing about saving and budgeting. When it comes to negative habits, theres actually a lot of consistency between generations. Roughly one-third of each generation has a habit of living from paycheck to paycheck and a significant fear of debt. Though less common, things like avoiding financial decisions (8%) and foregoing financial planning (5%) also affect each generation. Is Anyone Doing Better Financially Than Their Parents? There are some stark differences between how members of each generation view their own financial situation in relation to that of their parents.  55% of baby boomers said they were better off than their parents were at the same age. 20% said they had achieved about the same level of financial success and stability, and 19% claimed they were worse off than their parents. Only 33% of Gen X were better off financially than their parents. 25% were about the same, and 35% were worse off monetarily. 37% of millennials said they were in a better position than their mother and father, 26% were about the same and 33% were worse off. 41% of Gen Z said they were in a better place financially. 24% were about the same, and only 17% were worse off. Gen X and millennials are the least likely to say theyre better off, with Gen Z following closely. All of these generations have experienced financial challenges  like stagnant wages and rising student loan debt  that havent affected baby boomers to the same extent. This could be why baby boomers are more likely to claim theyre doing better than previous generations. All that to say, while financial education and habits may have played a role, external factors also affected each generations financial success. After all, a poor economy could have a significant effect on someones finances regardless of how well their parents prepared them. Majority of Gen Z Feels the Weight of Larger Financial Forces How big of an impact did external factors, such as economic recessions, have on participants financial experiences growing up? Roughly two of three baby boomers say outside factors influenced their financial upbringing. 64% of Gen X say the economy played a large role in their financial situation. 69% of millennials make the same claim Nearly 3 out of 4 members of Gen Z blame the economy for their financial development This upward trend could be due to an increasing awareness in each subsequent generation of how the overall economy affected their familys finances. After all, 65% of Americans also believe their parents decisions and habits were influenced by larger financial forces. Gen Z and Women Experience the Most Financial Stress What sort of emotions do Americans feel about their finances? Are people typically anxious or stressed about money? Are they more positive and empowered? Heres what we found: 29% of baby boomers said they felt anxiety or stress about their current financial situation. However, 61% primarily felt confidence or control over their money. 54% of Gen X reported stress and anxiety, with only 33% saying they were confident or in control of their financial situation. 51% of millennials admitted that they feel stressed about money, while 36% feel confident and in control. 59% of Gen Z were stressed or anxious, with only 35% reporting feeling empowered financially. We also looked at the role of gender when it comes to emotional associations with money. 38% of male participants admitted to anxiety or stress, with 50% reporting confidence and control. On the other hand, 48% of women feel financial stress , while only 39% feel confident. The difference in confidence could be due to the wealth gap between men and women. Households with women as the primary earners had 55 cents of wealth for every dollar in homes with male earners. Higher instances of stress in women are likely rooted in the challenge of having to work with much less than their male counterparts do. Debt and Overdrafts Are Normal for Millennials Certain generations are more likely to consider debt a normal part of their financial life than others: 35% of baby boomers thought debt was a normal part of their financial life based on family experiences growing up. 50% of Gen X participants felt the same. 48% of millennials thought debt was normal. 39% of Gen Z responded in the same way. Often, debt can arise due to improper use of credit cards . Collectively, Americans had approximately $1.14 trillion in credit card balances in mid-2024. While carrying a balance can lead to interest charges that increase overall debt, some people can manage their balances without experiencing snowballing debt. Which generations had positive credit card management practices? We looked at the top two reasons why each group used credit cards. Baby boomers used cards to maximize points and for convenience when making purchases. Gen X used cards to access credit when cash wasnt available and for convenience. Millennials used cards when they didnt have cash available and to build their credit score . Gen Z used cards to get points and boost their credit score. Overdrafts are another indicator of debt and potential spending issues. We asked the different generations how often theyd overdrawn accounts in the past year.  86% of baby boomers hadnt overdrawn and 10% had one or two overdrafts 66% of Gen X avoided overdrafts, with 19% having one or two and 9% reporting three overdrafts. 54% of millennials didnt overdraw, with 28% doing so once or twice and 10% three times. 6% overdrew six to 10 times. 61% of Gen Z avoided overextending their checking accounts. 26% had one or two overdrafts and 6% had three overdrafts Overall, younger generations are more likely to overdraw. Only 14% of baby boomers had any overdrafts, and 46% of millennials were drawing money they didn't have in their accounts. Societal Norms Also Contribute to Financial Trauma Society has a specific definition of financial success, which often involves steps like owning a home or having a savings account. These norms and expectations contribute to financial trauma for a whopping 57% of Americans . However, this perception is significantly different across generations. Only 48% of baby boomers feel this way, which is in stark contrast to 72% of Gen Z . Both Gen X (60%) and millennials (64%) were more middle of the road in comparison. Its clear that younger generations were more heavily impacted by societal norms compared to their older peers. Technology and social media may play a role, creating ever-present reminders of expectations and unrealistic depictions of financial success. The Biggest Barrier to Financial Stability? High Cost of Living Attitudes about personal finance and money education vary across generations. However, all agree on the most significant barrier to financial stability today. 38% of Americans believe the high cost of living is the biggest obstacle to achieving financial stability today. This was the top answer for each generation, with percentages ranging from 37% to 41% for each group. This comes as no surprise, given how dramatically the cost of living has risen over the last few years alone. Thats a financial pinch everyone can feel, regardless of their age. Lack of income or job opportunities (18%) was the second most popular answer for all generations except baby boomers. 28% of boomers were more worried about economic factors like inflation. This perhaps pointed to their reliance on income from retirement accounts rather than wages. Younger Americans Believe They Can Break the Cycle Despite these hurdles, many younger Americans are optimistic about being able to overcome harmful attitudes or financial habits. How confident is each generation about overcoming negative lessons and habits learned during their younger years? Heres how each group rates themselves:  Baby boomers were the most confident, with 44% claiming a high level of confidence and 92% feeling generally positive. Gen X was more tempered, with 23% reporting high confidence levels and 89% feeling highly or moderately confident. 28% of millennials gave themselves the highest rating, and 91% said they were reasonably optimistic. 33% of Gen Z respondents felt very confident That number jumped to 93% when moderately confident survey-takers were included. Baby boomers could have confidence from the experience and wealth theyve built up over the years. Younger generations may lack the job stability and experience of their older peers, but they have access to technology and tools that assist with financial management. Also, some have a safety net in the form of baby boomer parents who help them financially. Nearly half of Gen Z get such assistance from their mother or father.  When it comes to actually breaking the cycle of poor financial habits, Americans believe in the power of various solutions. Low-interest loans were the most popular choice overall (23% of respondents) , and also the favorite option for each generation. Other answers included accessible financial education (21%), personalized financial counseling, and target savings or investing (17% each). Americans also believe certain financial behaviors are best left in the past for the next generation to move forward: Saving and budgeting strategies : 27%; Investing for long-term security : 23%; Spending habits and consumerism : 21% Financial education and literacy : 13%. 16% of Americans dont think anything needs to change for future generations to find financial success. One generation in particular holds this view: a staggering 27% of baby boomers. Theyre about three times more likely to believe in the power of the status quo than Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z. Americans Avoid Working With Financial Professionals, Despite Their Helpfulness   Financial education and personalized counseling are important for everyones financial well-being. Heres the generational breakdown of whos actually sought help in this area: 19% of baby boomers; 18% of Gen X; 25% of millennials; 35% of Gen Z. Younger generations are more likely to seek professional financial advice. However, a majority of all generations still avoid taking this step. Worries about cost and fears of being embarrassed due to a lack of assets are factors that keep people in the realm of do-it-yourself financial management. Younger generations may be more willing to communicate about money with family and seek professional help if they need it. People in every age group can struggle to deal with financial challenges like the high cost of living and to overcome the negative money habits and attitudes that they learned when growing up. Methodology For this survey, we asked 1,000 adults a series of questions about their financial history. The only qualification was that they had at least one credit card. We broke the participants down into four categories: baby boomers, Generation X, millennials, and Generation Z. This allowed us to compare the answers between generations to see how they differed. We asked a series of questions about how the participants learned about and experienced personal finance while growing up. We also inquired about their current financial situation, attitudes, and skills to see how their past experiences affected their current financial management efforts.
