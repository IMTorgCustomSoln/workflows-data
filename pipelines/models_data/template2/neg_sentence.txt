I’ve been on hold for hours, listening to the same elevator music loop. 
At this point, I’m convinced it’s a secret form of torture.
The automated voice keeps saying, ‘Your call is important to us.’ Well, my sanity is important too!
I tried to explain my situation to the representative, but they just kept reading from a script. 
It’s like talking to a robot with a headset.
They transferred me to three different departments, and I still haven’t resolved my issue. 
Maybe I should start my own bank.
Is empathy not in their training manual?
I’m pretty sure the hold music is hypnotizing me. 
I’ll wake up one day and find out I’ve signed up for a timeshare in Antarctica.
They promised a callback within 24 hours. 
It’s been a week, and I’m still waiting. Maybe carrier pigeons would be faster.
I finally got through, and the representative said, ‘Sorry, we can’t help with that.’ I’m considering a career change to bank ninja.
I’m convinced the call center is located in an alternate dimension. Time moves differently there, and patience is a finite resource.
If I hear ‘due to high call volume’ one more time, I might start my own call center just to prove a point.
