An overdraft fee is charged when you withdraw more money from your account than what is available. 
If your balance is $50 and you write a check for $75, our system will cover the extra $25 but will charge you an overdraft fee for this service. 
The fee is typically $35 per transaction, and it helps cover the cost of the additional risk we take on when covering these transactions.
A Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) fee is applied when you try to make a payment or withdraw funds that exceed your account balance, and the bank is unable to cover the transaction. 
If you have $20 in your account and attempt to make a $30 purchase, the bank cannot process the payment, and you'll be charged an NSF fee, which is usually around $35. 
This fee helps us manage the costs associated with handling these situations.
We offer an overdraft protection service that can help you avoid fees when you overdraw your account. 
If you opt into this service, we link your checking account to your savings account or a line of credit. 
If you spend more than you have in your checking account, we’ll automatically transfer the necessary funds from your savings or credit line to cover the shortfall. 
There may be a fee for each transfer, but it’s generally less than an overdraft fee.
It’s important to understand the difference between overdraft fees and NSF fees. 
An overdraft fee occurs when we allow a transaction to go through even though you don't have sufficient funds, while an NSF fee is charged when a transaction is declined because of insufficient funds. 
Overdraft fees are typically incurred when you’ve opted into overdraft protection, while NSF fees are for transactions we can't process.
If you find yourself facing overdraft or NSF fees, please contact us. 
We often review fees on a case-by-case basis and may offer a waiver, especially if this is your first occurrence or if you have a good standing with us. 
We’re here to help you understand your options and avoid future fees.
Some accounts have a daily overdraft fee structure, where you are charged a fee for each day your account remains overdrawn. 
For example, if you overdraw your account and don’t bring it back to a positive balance, you might be charged a daily fee of $10 until the account is funded. 
This is in addition to any one-time overdraft fees that may apply.
If you use your debit card at an ATM and attempt to withdraw more funds than are available in your account, you might be charged an overdraft fee if you’ve opted into our overdraft protection. 
This fee is applied because the bank covers the extra amount you withdrew. 
If you haven’t opted into overdraft protection, the transaction will be declined, and you might incur an NSF fee instead.
